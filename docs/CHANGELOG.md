# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-30

Milestone 2: the storage data plane. Storage accounts and containers are the
first resources Nimbus genuinely backs rather than just remembering.

- **Blob, Queue and Table services**, stdlib-only, speaking the XML and OData
  wire formats the real clients expect. Containers, blobs (including Put Block
  / Put Block List for large uploads, byte ranges and metadata), queues with
  real visibility-timeout semantics, and tables with an OData `eq`/`and`
  filter subset.
- **Shared Key authentication is verified**, not waved through: a wrong key
  fails exactly as it would against Azure. Test vectors are signed by
  Microsoft's own SDKs rather than a second reading of the documentation.
- **`examples/terraform/azure-storage`** applies, plans clean and destroys.
- **`az storage blob upload/download/list`** works against a connection string
  from `nimbus env azure --storage-account NAME`.
- **`test/storage-sdk`** drives all three services with the Azure SDKs for
  Python, including a 2 MB block upload compared byte for byte.
- **Data survives `--persist`**: each account gets a directory under
  `~/.nimbus/data/storage`, with blobs as plain files you can `cat`.
- **Visualizer**: containers appear under their account, the inspector lists
  blobs with sizes and download links, and the four ARM `*/Services/default`
  plumbing resources are hidden from the graph.

Addressing, which was the milestone's real design problem: azurerm builds
data-plane URLs from the metadata suffix, not from `primaryEndpoints`, so a
bare hostname would send it to port 443 — which needs root. The suffix now
carries our port. Nested `*.localhost` names resolve to loopback on both macOS
and Windows with nothing installed, so no DNS tooling was needed.

Bugs found by running real clients, each with a regression test: the Table
service signs differently from blob and queue; storage accounts need four ARM
child resources or azurerm polls forever; containers created through ARM must
exist in the data plane; `Content-MD5` is a content setting and computing one
causes a perpetual blob replacement; metadata names must come back lower-cased
and un-canonicalised.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-30

First run against the real Terraform azurerm provider (4.81.0), on macOS 27
arm64. `examples/terraform/azure-basic` applies, plans clean and destroys;
state survives a `--persist` restart between apply and destroy; every resource
imports into a fresh state with a clean plan.

- **Fixed:** macOS rejected the server certificate Nimbus generates
  (`x509: "localhost" certificate is not standards compliant`). Apple caps the
  validity *span*, and backdating `NotBefore` put ours one hour over. Now 397
  days, computed from `NotBefore` as a UTC duration.
- **Fixed:** `EnsureCerts` reissued the CA whenever it reissued the server
  certificate, which would have forced a keychain re-trust. It now reuses an
  existing CA and reissues only the leaf, including when the leaf is near
  expiry or has a span macOS would reject.
- **Fixed:** a resource's `id` and `name` were taken from the request path on
  every write, so a client addressing an existing resource with different
  casing renamed it — a perpetual Terraform diff waiting to happen.
- Added tests for PATCH on a missing resource, malformed PUT bodies, cascade
  delete ordering, case-insensitive IDs across every verb, and the visualizer
  API, which had none.
- Added CI: `go vet` / `go test` / build on Linux, macOS and Windows, plus
  Linux jobs for the SDK harness and a real Terraform apply → plan → destroy.
- Investigated and did not change: azurerm's 20 s resource-group create and
  10 s-per-delete are client-side constants that nothing we return affects.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-30

- Azure Resource Manager emulator: metadata, client-secret tokens, OpenID discovery, generic CRUD for any resource type, resource groups, virtual networks and subnets with VNet/subnet sync, fast async-operation polling.
- Core store with cascade delete, optional persistence, event bus.
- Visualizer: live topology graph, activity feed, inspector; embedded, offline.
- Verified with `hashicorp/go-azure-sdk` via `test/sdkcompat`.
