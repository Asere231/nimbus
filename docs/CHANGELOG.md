# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-30

Milestone 3: AKS. `azurerm_kubernetes_cluster` starts a real Kubernetes
cluster — k3s in Docker — and `kubectl` talks to its actual API.

- **`internal/engines/docker`**: the `docker` CLI driven through
  `exec.Command`, with a `Fake` so the whole AKS hook is testable without a
  daemon. Daemon-down is recognised across runtimes and never mistaken for an
  operational failure; every call is timeout-bounded, because a hang tells you
  nothing while an error names Docker.
- **Real async operations.** The operation endpoint tracks per-operation
  state instead of always answering `Succeeded`, and `Hook` gained
  `Provision`/`Deprovision`, which run in the background while the write is
  answered immediately with `provisioningState: Creating`.
- **`examples/terraform/azure-aks`** applies, plans clean, scales
  `node_count` by adding agent containers, plans clean again, and destroys
  every container.
- **Credentials** are built from k3s's PEM files read out of the container,
  not from `k3s.yaml` — generating a kubeconfig is string formatting, parsing
  YAML is the one thing the stdlib cannot do. The same certificates give
  Nimbus an HTTPS client for the cluster API, so no `client-go` either.
- **The visualizer shows what is inside the cluster**: nodes, deployments,
  pods and services polled every few seconds and mirrored into the resource
  store, so the browser needs no Kubernetes knowledge.
- With `--persist`, clusters survive a restart and Nimbus reattaches to them,
  rebuilding the identical kubeconfig from the same container's certificates.

Bugs found by running the real provider: `kubeletidentity.resourceId` must be
a full ARM ID, not a name; and azurerm scales a node pool by writing the
`agentPools` child and reading the count back off the parent, so the two must
be mirrored.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-10-30

Milestone 2: the storage data plane. Storage accounts and containers are the
first resources Nimbus genuinely backs rather than just remembering.

- **Blob, Queue and Table services**, stdlib-only, speaking the XML and OData
  wire formats the real clients expect. Containers, blobs (including Put Block
  / Put Block List for large uploads, byte ranges and metadata), queues with
  real visibility-timeout semantics, and tables with an OData `eq`/`and`
  filter subset.
- **Shared Key authentication is verified**, not waved through: a wrong key
  fails exactly as it would against Azure. Test vectors are signed by
  Microsoft's own SDKs rather than a second reading of the documentation.
- **`examples/terraform/azure-storage`** applies, plans clean and destroys.
- **`az storage blob upload/download/list`** works against a connection string
  from `nimbus env azure --storage-account NAME`.
- **`test/storage-sdk`** drives all three services with the Azure SDKs for
  Python, including a 2 MB block upload compared byte for byte.
- **Data survives `--persist`**: each account gets a directory under
  `~/.nimbus/data/storage`, with blobs as plain files you can `cat`.
- **Visualizer**: containers appear under their account, the inspector lists
  blobs with sizes and download links, and the four ARM `*/Services/default`
  plumbing resources are hidden from the graph.

Addressing, which was the milestone's real design problem: azurerm builds
data-plane URLs from the metadata suffix, not from `primaryEndpoints`, so a
bare hostname would send it to port 443 — which needs root. The suffix now
carries our port. Nested `*.localhost` names resolve to loopback on both macOS
and Windows with nothing installed, so no DNS tooling was needed.

Bugs found by running real clients, each with a regression test: the Table
service signs differently from blob and queue; storage accounts need four ARM
child resources or azurerm polls forever; containers created through ARM must
exist in the data plane; `Content-MD5` is a content setting and computing one
causes a perpetual blob replacement; metadata names must come back lower-cased
and un-canonicalised.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-30

First run against the real Terraform azurerm provider (4.81.0), on macOS 27
arm64. `examples/terraform/azure-basic` applies, plans clean and destroys;
state survives a `--persist` restart between apply and destroy; every resource
imports into a fresh state with a clean plan.

- **Fixed:** macOS rejected the server certificate Nimbus generates
  (`x509: "localhost" certificate is not standards compliant`). Apple caps the
  validity *span*, and backdating `NotBefore` put ours one hour over. Now 397
  days, computed from `NotBefore` as a UTC duration.
- **Fixed:** `EnsureCerts` reissued the CA whenever it reissued the server
  certificate, which would have forced a keychain re-trust. It now reuses an
  existing CA and reissues only the leaf, including when the leaf is near
  expiry or has a span macOS would reject.
- **Fixed:** a resource's `id` and `name` were taken from the request path on
  every write, so a client addressing an existing resource with different
  casing renamed it — a perpetual Terraform diff waiting to happen.
- Added tests for PATCH on a missing resource, malformed PUT bodies, cascade
  delete ordering, case-insensitive IDs across every verb, and the visualizer
  API, which had none.
- Added CI: `go vet` / `go test` / build on Linux, macOS and Windows, plus
  Linux jobs for the SDK harness and a real Terraform apply → plan → destroy.
- Investigated and did not change: azurerm's 20 s resource-group create and
  10 s-per-delete are client-side constants that nothing we return affects.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-30

- Azure Resource Manager emulator: metadata, client-secret tokens, OpenID discovery, generic CRUD for any resource type, resource groups, virtual networks and subnets with VNet/subnet sync, fast async-operation polling.
- Core store with cascade delete, optional persistence, event bus.
- Visualizer: live topology graph, activity feed, inspector; embedded, offline.
- Verified with `hashicorp/go-azure-sdk` via `test/sdkcompat`.
